# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

Dependencies are managed with pnpm (10.25.0). Enable corepack if needed (for example `corepack prepare pnpm@10.25.0 --activate`) and install dependencies with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `pnpm run build` compile typescript to js
- `pnpm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `pnpm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `pnpx cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `pnpx cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `pnpx cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
